# Fat-Free Admin / Plugins

Place here plugin files that way:

* `./plugins` - The plugins main folder
  * `plugin-name/` - Your plugin folder
    * `plugin-files` - Your plugin files

Where plugins must be for now:

* `plugin-name.html` - The template `HTML` file
* `plugin-name.json` - The plugin definition file
* any other plugin related resources

> As the project is still in __Work in Progress__ state, the structure described above might change several times later.
